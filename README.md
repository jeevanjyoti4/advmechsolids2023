This is a repository of some useful files from the Advanced Mechanics of Solids course running in the Spring semester of 2023. It is a Depth course for the 4th year Dual Degree students in the Mechanical Systems Design specialization as well as for the 1st year Master of Technology students in the same specialization. 

* [Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and SymPy](https://nbviewer.org/github/jeevanjyoti4/advmechsolids2023/blob/master/intro_sympy.ipynb)

* [Simply-supported Beam under uniformly-distributed loading](https://nbviewer.org/github/jeevanjyoti4/advmechsolids2023/blob/master/simply_supported_UDL.ipynb) This file demonstrates the use of SymPy to easily a problem involving the use of the Airy stress function and the biharmonic equation of 2D elasticity. 

* [Polar Utilities](https://github.com/jeevanjyoti4/advmechsolids2023/blob/master/polarUtilities.py) This file contains a compilation of various useful function definitions to work with Airy stress functions in the polar coordinate system. It can be invoked using `from polarUtilities import *` from another Jupyter Notebook file.
